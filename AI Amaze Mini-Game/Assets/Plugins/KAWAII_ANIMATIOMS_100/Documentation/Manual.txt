Sorry.
I don't know how to get rid of the animation import error when making it humanoid, so I made it generic.
I need to make some modifications.

First, change the DummyDoll rig from generic to humanoid.
You can use presets to match bones to humanoids.

Next, update the animation rig.

That's it.

I looked into how to get rid of the animation import error when making it humanoid, but I couldn't figure it out.
I would appreciate it if anyone who knows the solution could let me know.
